## Motivation
According to the World Obesity Federation, 51% of the world will be obese or overweight within the next 12 years. Obesity carries with it significantly higher risks for developing diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and respiratory problems. To prevent obesity, most public health guidelines recommend that adults participate in 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the week. Research suggests that  pedometer readings usually serve as a motivational factor for physical activity behavior change. This is due to performance accomplishment that pedometers can facilitate. 

## Project Summary
A smart pedometer that can display the step count, measure speed, the number of calories burnt, and keep track of the user's BMI index. This device can also classify if the user is resting, walking or running. Furthermore, the device has also been optimised for low power consumption when at rest. Lastly, the device can calculate and output the confidence level (as a percentage) of the current activity classification using statistical analysis.

# Baseline firmware for the [Warp](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-hardware) family of hardware platforms
This is the firmware for the [Warp hardware](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-hardware) and its publicly available and unpublished derivatives. This firmware also runs on the Freescale/NXP FRDM KL03 evaluation board which we use for teaching at the University of Cambridge. When running on platforms other than Warp, only the sensors available in the corresponding hardware platform are accessible.

**Prerequisites:** You need an arm cross-compiler such as `arm-none-eabi-gcc` installed as well as a working `cmake` (installed, e.g., via `apt-get` on Linux or via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) on macOS). On Ubuntu, the package you need is `gcc-arm-none-eabi`. You will also need an installed copy of the SEGGER [JLink commander](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/), `JlinkExe`, which is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows (here are direct links for downloading it for [macOS](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_MacOSX.pkg), and [Linux tgz 64-bit](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Linux_x86_64.tgz)).

## 1.  Compiling the Warp firmware
First, edit [setup.conf](setup.conf) to set the variable `ARMGCC_DIR` and `JLINKPATH`. If your `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is in `/usr/local/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc`, then you want to set  `ARMGCC_DIR` to `/usr/local`. In the following, this `README.md` will refer to the top of the repository as `$TREEROOT`. On some platforms, you might need to also, in addition, set the `ARMGCC_DIR` environment variable in your shell (using `setenv` or `export` as appropriate), to point to the same path as you set in [setup.conf](setup.conf).

Second, edit [`tools/scripts/glaux.jlink.commands`](tools/scripts/glaux.jlink.commands) and [`tools/scripts/warp.jlink.commands`](tools/scripts/warp.jlink.commands) to replace `<full-path-to-warp-firmware>` with the full path to your Warp firmware directory.

Third, build the Warp firmware by

	make warp

Fourth, load the Warp firmware to hardware by

	make load-warp

To build for the Glaux variant, use `make glaux` and `make load-glaux` in steps three and four instead.

The build process copies files from `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/` into the `build/`, builds, and converts the binary to SREC. See `Warp/src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/README.md` for more. _When editing source, edit the files in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/`, not the files in `build` location, since the latter are overwritten during each build._

To connect to the running hardware to see output, you will need two terminal windows. In a separate shell window from the one in which you ran `make load-warp` (or its variants), launch the JLink RTT client<sup>&nbsp;<a href="#Notes">See note 1 below</a></sup>:

	JLinkRTTClient

## 2. Using the Warp firmware on the Freescale FRDMKL03 Board
The SEGGER firmware allows you to use SEGGER’s JLink software to load your own firmware to the board, even without using their specialized JLink programming cables. You can find the SEGGER firmware at the SEGGER Page for [OpenSDA firmware](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/opensda-sda-v2/).

To build the Warp firmware for the FRDM KL03, you will need to modify [this line in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/config.h`](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware/blob/9e7f9e5e3f3c039cc98cbd1e6dfeb6b8fd78c86a/src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/config.h#L55).


## 3.  Editing the firmware
The firmware is currently all in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/`, in particular, see `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/warp-kl03-ksdk1.1-boot.c` and the per-sensor drivers in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/dev*.[c,h]`.

The firmware builds on the Kinetis SDK. You can find more documentation on the Kinetis SDK in the document [doc/Kinetis SDK v.1.1 API Reference Manual.pdf](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware/blob/master/doc/Kinetis%20SDK%20v.1.1%20API%20Reference%20Manual.pdf).

The firmware is designed for the Warp and Glaux hardware platforms, but will also run on the Freescale FRDM KL03 development board. In that case, the only sensor driver which is relevant is the one for the MMA8451Q. For more details about the structure of the firmware, see [src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/README.md](src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/README.md).

## 4.  To update your fork
From your local clone:

	git remote add upstream https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware.git
	git fetch upstream
	git pull upstream master

### Notes
<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; On some Unix platforms, the `JLinkRTTClient` has a double echo of characters you type in. You can prevent this by configuring your terminal program to not echo the characters you type. To achieve this on `bash`, use `stty -echo` from the terminal. Alternatively, rather than using the `JLinkRTTClient`, you can use a `telnet` program: `telnet localhost 19021`. This avoids the JLink RTT Client's "double echo" behavior but you will then need a carriage return (&crarr;) for your input to be sent to the board.
